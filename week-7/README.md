# Data Analysis and Visualization Assignment

## Overview

This assignment involves loading a dataset, performing basic exploratory data analysis, and creating visualizations to better understand the data. You will use Pythonâ€™s `pandas` library for data manipulation and the `matplotlib` library for creating visual plots. The goal is to practice essential skills in data handling, basic statistical analysis, and visualizing trends and patterns in the data.

## Objective

The main objectives of this assignment are:

1. **Load and Analyze a Dataset:** 
   - Choose a CSV dataset and load it using the `pandas` library.
   - Perform basic data exploration, including inspecting the first few rows and checking for missing values.
   - Clean the data by handling any missing values appropriately.

2. **Basic Data Analysis:**
   - Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of numerical columns.
   - Group the data by a categorical variable and compute aggregate statistics (e.g., mean for each category).
   - Identify any interesting patterns, trends, or anomalies during your analysis.

3. **Create Visualizations:**
   - Use the `matplotlib` library to create at least four different types of plots:
     - A **line chart** to visualize trends over time.
     - A **bar chart** for comparing values across categories.
     - A **histogram** to understand the distribution of a numerical column.
     - A **scatter plot** to examine the relationship between two numerical variables.
   - Customize the visualizations with titles, axis labels, and legends.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
1. **Dataset Selection:**
   - Choose a dataset in CSV format. You can select from various publicly available datasets, such as the Iris dataset, sales data, or any dataset that interests you.
   
2. **Loading the Dataset:**
   - Use the `pandas` `read_csv()` function to load the dataset into a DataFrame.

3. **Data Exploration:**
   - Use `.head()` to display the first few rows of the dataset.
   - Check for missing data using `.isnull().sum()` to identify if there are any missing values in the dataset.
   - Inspect the data types of each column using `.dtypes` to ensure they are appropriate.

4. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values by either filling them with a default value (e.g., mean or median) or dropping rows/columns with missing values.

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Use the `.describe()` method on the DataFrame to generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for all numerical columns.

2. **Group Analysis:**
   - Choose a categorical column (e.g., species, region, department) and use the `groupby()` method to group data by that column.
   - For each group, calculate the mean (or other relevant statistics) of a numerical column.

3. **Analysis Findings:**
   - Look for interesting insights or patterns in the data. For example, do certain groups have higher values in specific numerical columns? Are there any outliers or unusual trends?

### Task 3: Data Visualization
1. **Line Chart:**
   - Create a line chart to show trends over time. This could be a time-series plot (e.g., monthly sales or temperature over the year).

2. **Bar Chart:**
   - Create a bar chart to compare a numerical variable across different categories (e.g., average sales by region or average petal length by species).

3. **Histogram:**
   - Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of a numerical column (e.g., distribution of sepal length or sales amounts).

4. **Scatter Plot:**
   - Create a scatter plot to show the relationship between two numerical columns (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length, or sales vs. advertising spend).

5. **Plot Customization:**
   - Customize the plots by adding titles, axis labels, and legends to make them clear and informative.

### Additional Instructions

1. **Dataset Suggestions:**
   - You can use datasets from publicly available sources such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or other open data sources.
   - The Iris dataset is a good starting point and can be accessed via `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`.

2. **Plot Customization:**
   - Use `matplotlib` for basic plotting and `seaborn` for enhanced visualizations, such as better aesthetics for bar charts, histograms, or scatter plots.
   
3. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle common errors, such as file not found or issues with data types, using `try-except` blocks to ensure robustness in your code.

4. **Submission Requirements:**
   - Submit a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) or a Python script (.py) that contains:
     - Data loading and exploration steps.
     - Basic data analysis results.
     - Visualizations.
     - Any observations or findings from the analysis.
     
   - Ensure that all plots are clearly labeled and provide insights into the data.
