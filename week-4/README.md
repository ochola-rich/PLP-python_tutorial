# Python Person Class Assignment

## Overview

This assignment involves creating a Python class named `Person` with specific attributes and methods to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles. The goal is to implement a class that models a person, provides an introduction method, and allows for the creation of an instance that displays the person's details.

## Instructions

1. **Create a Python Class `Person`**  
   Implement a class named `Person`. The class should have the following attributes:
   - `name`: The name of the person (string).
   - `age`: The age of the person (integer).
   - `gender`: The gender of the person (string).

2. **Introduce Method**  
   Implement a method within the `Person` class called `introduce`. This method should print a message introducing the person with their name, age, and gender in a readable format. The format of the introduction message should be clear and informative.

3. **Instance Creation**  
   After creating the `Person` class, create an instance of the class. Use the `introduce` method of the class to display the information about the created person.

4. **GitHub Repository**  
   Create a GitHub repository for this assignment. Push your solution to the repository and provide the link to the repository as part of your submission.
