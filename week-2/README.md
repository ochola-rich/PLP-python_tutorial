# List Manipulation in Dart

This guide outlines the steps for performing common list operations in Dart. It demonstrates how to create a list, modify its contents, and perform actions such as inserting, extending, sorting, and finding elements within the list.

### Objectives:
1. **Create an empty list**: Initialize an empty list called `my_list`.
2. **Append elements**: Add the elements `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to the list.
3. **Insert an element**: Insert the value `15` at the second position in the list.
4. **Extend the list**: Add another list of elements `[50, 60, 70]` to `my_list`.
5. **Remove an element**: Remove the last element from `my_list`.
6. **Sort the list**: Sort `my_list` in ascending order.
7. **Find an element's index**: Locate and print the index of the value `30` in `my_list`.

### Steps:

1. **Create an empty list**  
   Start by creating a list with no elements.

2. **Append elements to the list**  
   Add the following elements to the list: `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40`.

3. **Insert an element at a specific position**  
   Insert the value `15` into the list at the second position.

4. **Extend the list with another list**  
   Extend `my_list` by appending the list `[50, 60, 70]` to it.

5. **Remove the last element**  
   Remove the last element from the list to adjust its contents.

6. **Sort the list**  
   Sort `my_list` in ascending order so the elements appear from the smallest to the largest.

7. **Find and print the index of a specific value**  
   Locate the index of the value `30` in the list and print it.

### Expected Outcome:
By the end of these operations, you will have manipulated the list `my_list` to include several elements, inserted and removed values, extended it with another list, sorted it, and located the index of a specific value.
